# Impact demo

Checks the premise the record format rests on: that the records predict
what Horus will actually re-run when something changes.

Each scenario reads a run directory, predicts which tasks a change
reaches, then applies the change and runs the workflow so the prediction
can be compared against what the engine really did. The prediction is made
first, and uses nothing but the records.

## Install once

```bash
uv sync
```

If you do not have `uv`:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

This installs `horus-runtime` and the recorder from this repository, so
the demo runs against your working copy.

## Watch it run

```bash
uv run horus run workflow.yaml
```

`uv sync` builds `.venv` but does not put it on your `PATH`, so a bare
`horus` gives you `command not found`. Either prefix with `uv run`, or
activate the environment once and drop the prefix:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

In a real terminal this brings up the live dashboard: a progress bar, a
task table, and a **Dependencies tree** whose nodes change colour as each
task moves through pending, running, completed and skipped. That tree is
the DAG below.

Two things suppress it, both worth knowing because they look like the
feature is missing. Piping the output makes Rich fall back to a single
summary line, and `--no-tui` turns it off outright.

Run it a second time and every task turns skipped, because the outputs
already exist and their fingerprints still match.

The visual canvas you can drag stages around on is a different thing: it
belongs to the hosted Temple Compute platform, not to `horus-runtime`.

## Check the records against reality

```bash
./demo.sh
```

One scenario at a time:

```bash
./demo.sh 4
```

If `horus` is not on your `PATH`:

```bash
HORUS=.venv/bin/horus ./demo.sh
```

The demo writes records to `results/.horus-lineage` and **deletes
`results/` first** so the baseline is clean. To keep the records between
runs, send them elsewhere:

```bash
HORUS_LINEAGE_DIR=/tmp/demo-records ./demo.sh
```

It restores every file it edits, and leaves `results/` behind.

## The workflow

A diamond, so an impact question has a non-trivial answer:

```
data/raw.csv ──> prep ──┬──> analyse ──┐
                        │              ├──> report
                        └──> qc ───────┘

data/calibration.txt ──> analyse
data/reference.txt ────> report
```

## What each scenario shows

| # | Change | Point |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `calibration.txt` | Reaches `analyse` and `report`, not the parallel `qc` branch |
| 2 | `raw.csv` | The root input, so everything is downstream |
| 3 | `reference.txt` | Feeds only the last task, so nothing else moves |
| 4 | `scripts/qc.py` | A script, found through each task's `code` digests |

All four match the engine exactly on horus-runtime 0.5.0 or later.

Scenario 4 depends on the engine version. A runtime holds its script as
a path, so an edit changes neither `config_sha256` nor any input digest.
Since 0.5.0 the engine digests local files into the fingerprint and the
task re-runs. On an older engine it skips with stale code, and the
records are the only thing that names the affected tasks.

## impact.py

About 80 lines, reading only a run directory. Topology comes from the
`edges` in `definition.json`, identity from the content digests, code
changes from each task's `code` entries, and the machine each affected
task runs on from `target.location_id`.

It reports both a lower and an upper bound rather than one number. A task
re-runs only when its own inputs or config changed, so a cascade halts
wherever a task produces identical bytes from changed inputs. The full
downstream closure is a ceiling, not an answer.

This is a stand-in for Clew's `extract-horus`, not a replacement for it.
