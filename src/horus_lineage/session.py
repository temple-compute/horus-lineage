"""
The state one run shares between its four middlewares.

Middleware instances are constructed per context, so they cannot hold
shared state on ``self``. A context variable can: the workflow middleware
sets it before the chain runs, and every task the run creates inherits it,
because a new asyncio task copies the current context. Two workflows in
one process therefore keep separate sessions without coordinating.
