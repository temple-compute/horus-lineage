"""
What ``horus-lineage/v1`` promises, as something you can run.

This is where the format is stated: assertions a build can fail on,
rather than prose that is read once and then paraphrased. A field
renamed inside v1 is the change the version check cannot catch, and it
is the one that quietly empties a downstream graph rather than raising
anything.

Shipped rather than kept in tests, because the party who needs it most
is the reader on the other side of the format. A consumer runs this
against records it was handed and learns whether it holds a v1 record
or something that merely says it is one.

Two rules govern what belongs here:

Only what a reader would misread. A field that may be absent is checked
for type when present and never for presence, so an optional field never
becomes mandatory by being tested.

Never the recorder's internals. This reads a directory, so any producer
of v1 records can be held to it, not only this one.
