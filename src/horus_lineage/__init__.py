Records what a Horus run did, without changing what it does.

Four middlewares write one JSON record per task plus one per run, into a
run directory that is moved whole and joined by content digest.

Value of the ``format`` field on every record this package writes.

Readers check it and refuse versions they do not know. A semantic change
