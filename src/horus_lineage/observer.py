"""
The guard that keeps a recorder error from failing the run.

A recorder that can break the runs it records gets uninstalled the first
time it does. Every hook body goes through :func:`observe`, which logs and
swallows anything that goes wrong.

``CancelledError`` is deliberately not caught. It is how the event loop
tears a run down, and swallowing it would leave a coroutine running past
its own cancellation, which is a behaviour change rather than a recovery.
