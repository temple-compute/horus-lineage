Captures the command a task actually ran.

A workflow's arguments carry templates like ``${measurements}``, and the
engine substitutes them inside ``setup_runtime``, whose return value is
the formatted result. Wrapping that call is the only place the resolved
form exists, and the context carries the task, so it can be attributed.

The value is parked on the run's session for the task middleware to fold
into its record, because this fires while the task is still running.
