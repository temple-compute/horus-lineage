"""
Catches the tasks the task middleware never sees.

A skipped task returns from ``BaseTask.run`` before the task middleware
chain is entered, so nothing else can record it. Skips are the common case
in any workflow that is re-run, and a skipped task's outputs are real, so
leaving them out would break every edge through a cached task.

``dispatch`` only schedules the task and returns, so this waits on the
future the scheduler is about to wait on anyway, then records whatever the
task middleware did not.
