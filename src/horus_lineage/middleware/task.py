"""
The full record for a task that actually executed.

This overrides ``wrap`` rather than using ``after``, because ``after``
cannot see the outcome: ``BaseTask.run`` assigns COMPLETED or FAILED in
the block *around* the middleware chain, so inside ``after`` the status is
always RUNNING. Watching whether ``call_next`` raised gives the status the
engine is about to assign.
