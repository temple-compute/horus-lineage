"""
Reading derivation back out of a run directory.

The records say what each task consumed and produced, with a digest on
every artifact. That is enough to rebuild what came from what: an input
whose sha256 matches some task's output was produced by that task, and
one matching nothing came from outside the run.

Declared edges from ``definition.json`` fill the gaps, because two kinds
of artifact carry no digest. Folders, which the engine will not hash,
and subworkflow ports, which are placeholders with no file behind them.

Nothing here renders. It answers structural questions about a run
directory, which is what ``conformance`` and any other reader needs.
